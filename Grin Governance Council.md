# Grin Governance Council (GGC)

**The Grin Council has been unified, merging the former Original Council (OC) and the Community Council (CC) into a single leadership team aimed at a fresh start for the project.** This consolidation aims to unify efforts towards Grin's goals under one governing body.

The Council's main task is to control and direct Grin's funding to support Grin core development, ecosystem projects, bounties, and community activities.

## Current Council Members & Keyholders:

The merged Grin Council comprises members from both former councils, with specific roles and keyholding responsibilities for a new **4 of 7 MultiSignature wallet**. This MultiSig structure requires a strict majority (4 out of 7) for signing transactions while maximizing the number of keys that can be lost without losing access to funds.

**Keyholders (for the 4/7 MultiSig):**

*   @tromp
*   @davidburkett (participating only as a keyholder for council member @trab)
*   @Anynomous
*   @wiesche
*   @aglkm (also known as Bruges)
*   @waynegeorge
*   @transatoshi

**Other Council Members & Roles:**

*   @Yeastplume (not a keyholder, but will manage the Mimblewimble (MW) organization and its processes for the interim).

**Former Leadership Members Stepping Back from Direct Leadership (but remaining community members):**

*   @quentinlesceller
*   @oryhp

## Background

Since its launch in 2019, Grin development was primarily funded by donations to the Grin General Fund, initially managed by the *Original Grin Council (OC)*. In May 2021, to further decentralize governance and support a broader range of community projects, a portion of these funds was allocated to a newly formed *Grin Community Council (CC)*.

After a period of operating with two councils, it was mutually agreed by members of both the OC and CC to merge these counsils. This decision reflects a desire to streamline governance, unify efforts, and provide a single point of leadership for the Grin project.

Key members from the OC, including Tromp and Yeastplume, have joined the reformed council structure to facilitate this new beginning. Tromp has taken on a keyholder role, while Yeastplume will continue to manage the Mimblewimble GitHub organization during the transition period.

## Grin Unified Fund

With the merging of the councils, the previously separate *Grin Development Fund* and *Grin Community Fund* will be consolidated into a single fund, secured by the new 4-of-7 MultiSignature wallet. This fund will rely on continued community donations to support Grin's growth across __core development, community projects, bounties, and activities.__ If you want to keep Grin growing, please consider donating (donation addresses to be updated/confirmed by the new Grin Governance council).

## Council Meetings (Assumed - To be Confirmed by New Council)

Details regarding the meeting schedule, agenda setting, and participation for the new unified Grin Council will likely be established and communicated by its members. It is anticipated that meetings will continue to be open to the community, fostering a friendly and respectful environment for expressing opinions and ideas. (Community members should look for official announcements from the unified council regarding meeting protocols).

## Obligations of Grin Council Members (Assumed - To be Confirmed by New Council)

Grin Council members are primarily representatives of the community and keyholders/stewards of the project's funds. They are expected to:
*   Responsibly manage the keys of the unified fund's MultiSignature wallet.
*   Manage Funding Requests and Bounties in accordance with newly established or revised spending guidelines.
*   Actively participate in council activities and decision-making. If a council member cannot participate for a prolonged time, they should consider stepping down if more suitable representatives are available.
